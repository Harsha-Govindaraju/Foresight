# Foresight

This tool is a small JavaScript library that lets your users/visually challenged access the web with voice commands. It is built on top of the Webkit Speech API, SpeechSynthesisutterance and helps visually challenged to access the web by using these options Text to Speech, Speech Recognition and tracking user interaction.

This tool is free to use and modify under the MIT license.

## What problem does this solve?

Wouldnâ€™t it be great if visually challenged could interact with websites just like Siri on Alexa without navigating it to any page ? In other words, you could ask web pages questions out loud and get answers spoken back to you?

## What advantage this has?

- Single view, Users do not need to navigate to other pages to explore the web.
- Speak/Use Keyboard to give your inputs and get response back in same window like google search of something or youtube video everything is in one place.
- Users don not need to install any third party or it doesn't contorl your total browser.

## Browser support
